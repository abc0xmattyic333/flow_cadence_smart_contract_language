# Keys

Keys or account keys are used to sign transactions. In Cadence, an account can have many keys. These keys can be shared or revoked, providing native verison of account abstraction that is extremely powerful. For example, you can use it to build an app that pulls NFTs in an embedded wallet in one app into that user's browser wallet and then use them in your app.
