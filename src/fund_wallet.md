# Fund Wallet

I wanted to explore how to obtain some Testnet Flow. The first thing you will need to install in your browser is the [Flow Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/flow-wallet/hpclkefagolihohboafpheddmmgdffjm?hl=en&pli=1)

You will want to setup an account, once you have an account you will need to enable the developer toggle within the settings of the wallet.

You can take a look at the images folder and see that we have switched the Network from Mainnet to testnet.

You can see we funded our account, and the amount of account storage we used. [Flow Testnet Transaction](https://testnet.flowscan.io/account/0x28ac73e260aace7b)
